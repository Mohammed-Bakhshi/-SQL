## Joing 3 tables in SQL 

using the w3school envioment https://www.w3schools.com/sql/  

 First half i joined 3 tables together from products,orders and customers then i made it only show the shipper name as United Package and the order date 1996-7-4.    

Secondly I Created a second SQL query that uses the same database, however the data returned had 2 columns, ProductName from the products database and a second column with the total sales in 2017 for each product.
